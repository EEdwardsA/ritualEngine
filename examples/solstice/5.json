    "I got a pro... blem... The weather's getting cold...",
    "The northern wind blows sharp & swift my jackets worn and old",
    "But all I need to know is in the tales my poppa told\n.",
    "I choose a pelt that thick and warm... measure twice and chalk my form",
    "I cut and stitch 'ere com-ing sto-o-orm... And now I'm",
    "safe and snug\n.",
    "I got a pro... blem... It seems I lost my way...",
    "I've journeyed forth to lands unknown been wandering all day",
    "I need some help. Can I recall what did my momma say?\n.",
    "I lift my eyes up past the air. Follow the tail of Greater Bear",
    "I see that north is over there... And now I'm",
    "homeward bound\n.",
    "I got a pro... blem... What if this lore's not true?",
    "What if what worked in days of old don't work for me and you?",
    "I don't despair I got a plan; what grampa said to do!\n.",
    "I check the facts with my own eyes I do the math, I analyze",
    "I get a p less than 0h five And now that",
    "problem's solved\n.",
    "I got a pro... blem... Results won't replicate!",
    "A garden full of forking paths, the choice to speak too late",
    "Can Sol'monoff quite help me here? Do I, um, hang out, wait...\n.",
    "I... I got a problem."
