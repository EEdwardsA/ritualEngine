Welcome, one and all, to the 

1
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.499 line:1
Secular Solstice celebration
for 2020.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.599 line:1
This is not the Secular
Solstice celebration.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.489 line:1
This is the song before the
Secular Solstice celebration.

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.789 line:1
Ray's asked me to do the
warming up tune, and tonight

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.789 line:1
that's going to be
"Necronomicon", which is Ray's

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.799 line:1
version of "Winter Wonderland"
with just much darker themes.

7
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.489 line:1


8
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.079 line:1
now. If you were not aware,
Secular Solstice every year is

9
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.099 line:1
a big sing-along, normally with
everyone in a room, and they've

10
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.599 line:1
put together some technologies
to try and recreate that

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.999 line:1
given that we're all in our
homes,

12
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.299 line:1
where 

13
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.599 line:1
we'll all be staggered. 

14
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.199 line:1
So,

15
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.989 line:1
people who sing before you,
you'll be able to hear them,

16
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.899 line:1
sing along with them,

17
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.289 line:1
and the people who sing after
you will be able to hear you

18
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.499 line:1
and sing along with you.

19
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.799 line:1
So please send your heart out,
and

20
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.099 line:1
the more everyone

21
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.499 line:1
does that, the better it'll go.
Fingers crossed.

22
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.999 line:1
So without further ado, we'll
sing "Necronomicon".
