At the winter solstice, 

1
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.999 line:1
the longest night of the year, 

2
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.599 line:1
we take time to consider 

3
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.799 line:1
the virtue of darkness: 

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.499 line:1
the strength 

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.099 line:1
and honesty 

6
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.399 line:1
to face what is dark, 

7
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.099 line:1
and hard, 

8
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.799 line:1
and true. 

9
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.799 line:1
The virtue of darkness 

10
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.999 line:1
is the willingness to stare
into challenges

11
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.799 line:1
so immense they seem unsolvable, 

12
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.899 line:1
and not look away. 

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.989 line:1
Solstice also cultivates the
virtue of fire:

14
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.299 line:1
the virtue of ambition, and
problem-solving,

15
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.389 line:1
and a visceral desire to do
something, to fight back

16
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.899 line:1
against the dark and the cold.

17
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.649 line:1
It is gathering together to
tell stories of the beautiful

18
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.899 line:1
futures we see flickering in
the flames.

19
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.399 line:1
It is electricity, 

20
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.999 line:1
and rockets, 

21
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.899 line:1
and the dream of a different
existence.

22
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.299 line:1
And then, 

23
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.299 line:1
there is the virtue of ash: 

24
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.199 line:1
the virtue of resilience, 

25
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.899 line:1
of carrying on. 

26
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.999 line:1
It is the virtue of looking at
the burnt ruins of a house

27
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.599 line:1
you spent years building, 

28
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.499 line:1
of feeling sick 

29
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.999 line:1
with the weight of what was
lost,

30
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.399 line:1
and beginning to rebuild, 

31
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.899 line:1
because 

32
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.499 line:1
what else is there to do but
rebuild?

33
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.999 line:1
Where else is there to go 

34
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.499 line:1
but back up the mountain, 

35
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.299 line:1
pushing yourself 

36
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.999 line:1
and your dreams higher once
again.

37
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.599 line:1
The virtue of ash 

38
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.199 line:1
means somehow making the
possibilities of the future

39
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.099 line:1
feel more salient than the
aching absence of what was lost.

40
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.198 line:1
It means seeing today 

41
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.899 line:1
as the starting point for
tomorrow,

42
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.889 line:1
even when the scale of broken
things we must rebuild

43
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.099 line:1
seems unfathomable. 

44
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.399 line:1
It means 

45
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.999 line:1
beginning to lay a new
foundation,

46
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.889 line:1
even when you know you may
never live to see the house

47
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.299 line:1
built on it

48
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.499 line:1
shining 

49
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.899 line:1
with warmth and wholeness again, 

50
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.099 line:1
the way it was 

51
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.999 line:1
on that last night in your
memory.
