    "From desert cliff and mountaintop",

    "erosion makes it known,",
    "And count the countless aeons in the",
    "banding of the stone.\n ",
    "Odd long vanished creatures & their",
    "tracks & shells are found",
    "Where truth has left its sketches on the",
    "slate below the ground.",
    "The patient stone can speak,",
    "if we but listen when it talks.\n ",
    "Humans wrote the book of earth…",
    " \n…\n ",
    "Time wrote the rocks.\n ",
    "There are those who name the stars,",
    "who watch the sky by night,",
    "Seeking out the darkest place,",
    "to better see the light.",
    "Long ago, when isolation",
    "broke his weary will,",
    "Galileo recanted, but the",
    "Earth is moving still.\n ",
    "High above the mountaintops,",
    "where only distance bars,",

    "shudder and deny\n ",
