Hello.

1
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.999 line:1
It's the 20th century.

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.188 line:1
It's the year 2020 and when
you're hearing this, it's

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.899 line:1
December 19th.

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.699 line:1
It's right here. 

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.299 line:1
Right now. 

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.199 line:1
This moment. 

7
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.289 line:1
And we're entering the middle
of the solstice ceremony,

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.688 line:1
which means we're passing from
the past into the present,

9
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.699 line:1
and from light into darkness. 

10
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.289 line:1
You might take a moment now in
this transition just to look

11
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.189 line:1
around your surroundings and
see if there's anything else

12
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.799 line:1
you might need for the rest of
the night.

13
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.099 line:1
Maybe you want to dim your main
lights.

14
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.499 line:1
Maybe you want to light candles
if you haven't already.

15
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.399 line:1
Maybe want to grab a glass of
water or hot chocolate.

16
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.989 line:1
You can go do that now, we'll
be here in a minute and you

17
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.999 line:1
won't miss much.

18
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.299 line:1
While some people are off doing
that,

19
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.899 line:1
I just wanted us to take a
moment to really be

20
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.299 line:1
here. 

21
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.699 line:1
Together. 

22
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.199 line:1
I know it's kind of tricky
because

23
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.799 line:1
you know for 

24
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.488 line:1
for a lot of you I don't even
know where "here" is,

25
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.088 line:1
you could be listening to my
voice from a few blocks away

26
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.699 line:1
or a few timezones away.

27
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.099 line:1
But 

28
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.599 line:1
but we are trying to be here
together.

29
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.989 line:1
We're trying to do this kind of
weird new ritual where we're

30
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.899 line:1
all staring into these glowing
rectangles and

31
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.189 line:1
I know it might be a little
hard to remember that the

32
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.699 line:1
people on the other side of
those rectangles - they're

33
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.599 line:1
they're real. 

34
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.689 line:1
You might also notice you have
some habits regarding little

35
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.189 line:1
glowing rectangles. If things
get uncomfortable or there's

36
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.099 line:1
just a little logistical hiccup,

37
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.499 line:1
you 

38
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.699 line:1
might get 

39
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.689 line:1
pulled a little out of the
moment, you might find

40
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.588 line:1
yourself twitching your
fingers and then suddenly

41
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.199 line:1
you're on Facebook and

42
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.588 line:1
you're doing that instead of
being here with us and trying

43
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.799 line:1
to process difficult truths
about reality.

44
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.398 line:1
Now, obviously place your
attention where you want it,

45
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.099 line:1
but it's easy to

46
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.799 line:1
be on these rectangles and just
have our attention pulled

47
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.299 line:1
somewhere that we don't even
really want it.

48
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.599 line:1
So 

49
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.899 line:1
something you might try, that
I'm going to try, is

50
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.399 line:1
you know, when you feel your
attention start to wander,

51
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.899 line:1
and you've so much affordance
just to

52
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.399 line:1
open up that tab, 

53
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.699 line:1
just instead 

54
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.599 line:1
maybe just 

55
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.899 line:1
breathe. 

56
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.799 line:1
You can take a breath. 

57
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.299 line:1
And just focus your attention
on your body and

58
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.799 line:1
ask, what's it like to be you
right now?

59
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.289 line:1
Maybe you'll take a breath and
you'll focus your attention on

60
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.589 line:1
the other people on the screen
here and just spend a few

61
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.699 line:1
moments thinking,

62
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.499 line:1
oh man that tiny rectangular
window,

63
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.999 line:1
that's 

64
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.889 line:1
connected through fibers and
internet to a person, and

65
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.289 line:1
they're alive right now,
thinking thoughts

66
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.999 line:1
and feeling feelings and 

67
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.289 line:1
some of them might be people
you know, you can kind of

68
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.099 line:1
imagine the thoughts and
feelings and

69
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.989 line:1
some of them they might be
strangers, but they are the

70
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.389 line:1
sort of strangers who chose to
spend their evenings at this

71
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.999 line:1
event, together with us.

72
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.299 line:1
So as you breathe, maybe just
direct your attention to

73
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.999 line:1
what's it like to be them right
now?

74
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.699 line:1
And before we truly begin the
descent into darkness,

75
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.689 line:1
I want us to take a moment to
be here together and just take

76
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.199 line:1
7 deep breaths.

77
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.899 line:1
Thank you.
