Hey, everyone. 

1
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.599 line:1
Welcome to 2020 Western
Continental Secular Solstice.

2
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.399 line:1
This has been a 

3
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.999 line:1
pretty intense year. 

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.499 line:1
This is going to be a 

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.999 line:1
pretty weird Solstice, and I'm
sorry.

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.289 line:1
And I'm sorry in particular
that we can't all, like,

7
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.598 line:1
actually be together
physically where, like, you can

8
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.598 line:1
be like, oh, there's a monkey
singing, and I'm also a monkey

9
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.789 line:1
and I'm singing, and we're all
singing together, and ahh, singing

10
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.199 line:1
together monkeys is great.

11
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.199 line:1
And we're not going to have
that in the canonical way.

12
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.199 line:1
You might think of that this
year,

13
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.299 line:1
and that's sad. 

14
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.299 line:1
But,

15
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.489 line:1
I am in fact kind of excited
about the fact that in some

16
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.999 line:1
ways,

17
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.199 line:1
we are more all together this
year than we ever have been in

18
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.899 line:1
the past.

19
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.289 line:1
There's people tuning in here
from Berkeley and from Boston

20
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.089 line:1
and from New Hampshire and
from undisclosed locations in

21
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.399 line:1
the woods, and I,

22
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.099 line:1
I am like 

23
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.099 line:1
just sort of boggled by the
prospect of

24
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.799 line:1
all of us being together like
never before.

25
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.099 line:1
We have put 

26
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.399 line:1
a 

27
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.288 line:1
stupidly ridiculous amount of
effort into building this

28
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.199 line:1
custom Solstice app so we can
all sing together for actuals.

29
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.499 line:1
I hope it works.

30
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.689 line:1
Now some of you might be like,
okay, so I've been to, like, ten

31
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.199 line:1
Secular

32
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.689 line:1
Solstices and this
one's all weird and different

33
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.989 line:1
and it's in a little rectangle,
and is it really going to be

34
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.999 line:1
the same, and what's exactly
going to happen to me?

35
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.699 line:1
I don't know and I'm a little
bit scared.

36
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.599 line:1
And some of you might be like,
whoa.

37
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.799 line:1
I've never been to a Secular
Solstice before in my life,

38
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.788 line:1
and I went to this one
because it was ridiculously

39
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.799 line:1
convenient and I'm not even
wearing pants,

40
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.699 line:1
but also, what's going to happen
to me though?

41
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.999 line:1
I don't really know what's
going on.

42
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.599 line:1
To both of you,

43
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.499 line:1
we will answer those questions
in

44
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.699 line:1
just a second. 

45
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.199 line:1
But, first,

46
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.299 line:1
we've got a little story for
you.
