Hey everyone. 

1
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.599
Welcome to 2020 Western
Continental Secular Solstice.

2
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.399
This has been a 

3
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.999
pretty intense year. 

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.499
This is going to be a 

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.999
pretty weird Solstice and I'm
sorry

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.289
and I'm sorry in particular
that we can't all like

7
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.598
actually be together
physically where like you can

8
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.598
be like, oh, there's a monkey
singing and I'm also a monkey

9
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.789
and I'm singing and we're all
singing together in a single

10
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.199
together monkeys is great

11
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.199
and we're not going to have
that in the canonical way.

12
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.199
You might think of that this
year

13
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.299
and that's sad. 

14
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.299
But 

15
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.489
I am in fact kind of excited
about the fact that in some

16
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.999
ways.

17
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.199
We are more all together this
year than we ever have been in

18
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.899
the past.

19
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.289
There's people tuning in here
from Berkeley and from Boston

20
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.089
and from New Hampshire and
from undisclosed locations in

21
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.399
the woods, and I

22
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.099
I am like 

23
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.099
just sort of boggled by the
prospect of

24
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.799
all of us being together like
never before.

25
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.099
We have put 

26
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.399
a 

27
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.288
stupidly ridiculous amount of
effort into building this

28
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.199
custom Solstice app so we can
all sing together for actuals.

29
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.499
I hope it works 

30
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.689
now some of you might be like,
okay, so I've been to like 10

31
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.199
second.

32
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.689
There's also this is and this
one's all weird and different

33
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.989
and it's a little rectangle
and is it really going to be

34
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.999
the same and what's exactly
going to happen to me?

35
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.699
I don't know and I'm a little
bit scared

36
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.599
and some of you might be like,
whoa.

37
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.799
I've never been to a secular
socialist before in my life.

38
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.788
Life and I went to this one
because it was ridiculously

39
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.799
convenient and I'm not even
wearing pants.

40
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.699
But also what's going to happen
to me though.

41
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.999
I don't really know what's
going on

42
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.599
to both of you. 

43
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.499
We will answer those questions
in

44
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.699
just a second. 

45
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.199
But first 

46
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.299
we've got a little story for
you.
