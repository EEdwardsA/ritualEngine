    "Let us pause in life's pleasures",
    "and count its many tears",
    "While we all sup sorrow with the poor",
    " ",
    "There's a song that will",
    "linger forever in our ears",
    "Oh Hard times come again no more",
    " ",
    "Tis the song, the sigh of the weary",
    "Hard times, hard times, come again no more",
    "Many days must we labor,",
    "to reach that distant shore",
    "Oh hard times come again no more",
    " ",
    "While we seek mirth and beauty",
    "and music bright and gay",
    "There are frail forms fainting at the door",
    " ",
    "Though their voices are silent,",
    "their pleading looks will say",
    "Oh hard times come again no more",
    " ",
    "Tis the song, the sigh of the weary",
    "Hard times, hard times, come again no more",
    "Many days must we labor,",
    "to reach that distant shore",
    "Oh hard times come again no more",
    " ",
    "Tis a sigh that is wafted",
    "across the troubled wave",
    "Tis a wail that is heard upon the shore",
    " ",
    "Tis a dirge that is murmured",
    "around the lowly grave",
    "Oh hard times come again no more",
    " ",
    "Tis the song, the sigh of the weary",
    "Hard times, hard times, come again no more",
    "Many days must we labor,",
    "to reach that distant shore",
    "Oh hard times come again no more",
    "Oh hard times come again no more"
