    "Hello darkness, my old friend",
    "I've come to talk with you again",
    "Because a vision softly creeping",
    "Left its seeds while I was sleeping",
    "And the vision that was planted in my brain",
    "Still remains",
    "Within the sound of silence",
    " ",
    "In restless dreams I walked alone",
    "Narrow streets of cobblestone",
    "'Neath the halo of a street lamp",
    "I turned my collar to the cold and damp",
    "When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light",
    "That split the night",
    "And touched the sound of silence",
    " ",
    "And in the naked light, I saw",
    "Ten thousand people, maybe more",
    "People talking without speaking",
    "People hearing without listening",
    "People writing songs that voices never share",
    "And no one dared",
    "Disturb the sound of silence",
    " ",
    "'Fools', said I, 'You do not know",
    "Silence like a cancer grows",
    "Hear my words that I might teach you",
    "Take my arms that I might reach you'",
    "But my words, like silent raindrops fell",
    "And echoed",
    "In the wells of silence",
    " ",
    "And the people bowed and prayed",
    "To the neon god they made",
    "And the sign flashed out its warning",
    "In the words that it was forming",
    "And the sign said:",
    "'The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls'",
    "And tenement halls",
    "And whispered in the sound of silence"
