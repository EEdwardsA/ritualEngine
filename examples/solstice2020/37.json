    "A possible child,\nDreaming through the longest night,",

    "Build ourselves a brand new home,",
    "Raise the glass domes high.",
    "And in a century or three",

    "I don't quite know what world we'd make\n ",
    "I don't quite know how things might change",
    "I don't quite know what rules we'd break",
    "Our present selves might think it strange",
    "But there's so many lives at stake...\n ",
    "Entropy is bearin' down",
    "But we got tricks to stick around.",
    "And if we live to see the day",
    "That yellow might fade to red then grey,\n ",
