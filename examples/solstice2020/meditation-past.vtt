The solstice starts far in the
past.

1
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.799 line:1
We're about to take a journey
there.

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.999 line:1
Let's start small. 

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.499 line:1
Who were you yesterday? 

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.999 line:1
What were you doing? 

5
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.299 line:1
Now, a larger step.

6
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.999 line:1
Think of who you were a year
ago.

7
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.799 line:1
What have you learned? 

8
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.399 line:1
How have you changed? 

9
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.799 line:1
Are you the same person now as
you were then?

10
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.999 line:1
Further back now.

11
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.889 line:1
Think of your earliest memories,
as far back as you can remember

12
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.969 line:1
when you are somehow
identifiably you -

13
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.509 line:1
the personality core at that
would carry you forward

14
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.549 line:1
to the present day. 

15
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.899 line:1
Think of your parents, teachers,
or guides.

16
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.999 line:1
Who were they? 

17
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.299 line:1
Where did they come from? 

18
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.399 line:1
Did they lead you by example?

19
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.899 line:1
Or were they a cautionary tale
of what not to become?

20
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.399 line:1
What made them who they were,
such that they led you

21
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.499 line:1
to become you?

22
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.599 line:1
Now let's begin to drift
further back.

23
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.489 line:1
Think of the cultures that
shaped your parents or mentors

24
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.299 line:1
or peer groups.

25
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.999 line:1
Did they have religion?

26
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.099 line:1
Did they have an intellectual
community?

27
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.788 line:1
Did they come from a culture or
country

28
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.499 line:1
with a strong set of traditions? 

29
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.199 line:1
What do you know of the cultures 

30
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.399 line:1
that shaped the people who
shaped you?

31
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.889 line:1
Now, think of the earliest
stories

32
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.299 line:1
that shaped those cultures.

33
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.399 line:1
As far back as you know.

34
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.399 line:1
What is the earliest clear
memetic seed you can find

35
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.189 line:1
that would one day become the
culture that shaped the people

36
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.499 line:1
who shaped you in turn?

37
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.099 line:1
And now,

38
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.299 line:1
think of the earliest stories
you know of, period.

39
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.399 line:1
Far and far and far away back, 

40
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.299 line:1
the first inklings of a dream
that humans breathed into words

41
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.099 line:1
that echoed across history. 

42
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.499 line:1
Think of the first human
explorers who discovered winter.

43
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.889 line:1
Imagine surprise or delight the
first time a human being saw

44
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.599 line:1
snowflakes falling.

45
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.899 line:1
Imagine that surprise 

46
00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.299 line:1
turning to worry 

47
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.399 line:1
as the snow falls kept coming. 

48
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.799 line:1
Think of what it would have
been like

49
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.799 line:1
to see the darkness descending. 

50
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.999 line:1
And not to know why.
