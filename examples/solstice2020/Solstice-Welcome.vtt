Hey everyone. 

1
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.499 line:1
Welcome to 2020 western
continental Secular Solstice.

2
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.399 line:1
This has been a 

3
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.899 line:1
pretty intense year. 

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.499 line:1
This is going to be a 

5
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.999 line:1
pretty weird Solstice, and I'm
sorry.

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.188 line:1
And I'm sorry in particular
that we can't all, like,

7
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.589 line:1
actually be together
physically where, like, you

8
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.589 line:1
can be like, ah, there's a
monkey singing and I'm also a

9
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.778 line:1
monkey and I'm singing and
we're all singing together and

10
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.199 line:1
ah! singing together monkeys is
great!

11
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.099 line:1
And we're not going to have
that in the canonical way

12
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.199 line:1
you might think of that this
year

13
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.299 line:1
and that's sad. 

14
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.299 line:1
But 

15
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.999 line:1
I am in fact kind of excited
about the fact that in some ways

16
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.199 line:1
We are more all together this
year than we ever have been in

17
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.899 line:1
the past.

18
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.289 line:1
There's people tuning in here
from Berkeley and from Boston

19
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.089 line:1
and from New Hampshire and
from undisclosed locations in

20
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.399 line:1
the woods, and I

21
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.099 line:1
am, like, 

22
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.099 line:1
just sort of boggled by the
prospect of

23
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.899 line:1
all of us being together like
never before.

24
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.099 line:1
We have put 

25
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.399 line:1
a 

26
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.288 line:1
stupidly ridiculous amount of
effort into building this

27
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.199 line:1
custom Solstice app so we can
all sing together for actuals.

28
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.499 line:1
I hope it works. 

29
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.689 line:1
Now some of you might be, like,
okay, so I've been to like 10

30
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.199 line:1
Secular Solstices,

31
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.689 line:1
And this one's all weird and
different and it's in a little

32
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.588 line:1
rectangle and is it really
going to be the same and

33
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.999 line:1
what's exactly going to happen
to me?

34
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.799 line:1
I don't know, and I'm a little
bit scared.

35
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.599 line:1
And some of you might be like,
whoa,

36
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.788 line:1
I've never been to a Secular
Solstice before in my life,

37
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.199 line:1
and I went to this one because
it was ridiculously convenient.

38
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.899 line:1
And I'm not even wearing pants. 

39
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.699 line:1
But also, what's going to
happen to me though,

40
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.999 line:1
I don't really know what's
going on.

41
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.699 line:1
To both of you, 

42
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.599 line:1
we will answer those questions
in

43
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.799 line:1
just a second. 

44
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.299 line:1
But first 

45
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.399 line:1
we've got a little story for
you.

46
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.399 line:1
The winter solstice is the
longest night of the year.

47
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.299 line:1
It marks the beginning of the
return of the light.

48
00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.789 line:1
For ancient peoples, whether
you are dealing with literal

49
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.899 line:1
ice and snow

50
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.999 line:1
or just a cold and rainy season, 

51
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.999 line:1
it's important to know when the
year would end.

52
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.399 line:1
It's a sort of default 

53
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.099 line:1
holiday of sorts for humanity. 

54
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.099 line:1
And 

55
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.299 line:1
along the way, 

56
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.699 line:1
people had stories talking
about this.

57
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.689 line:1
They shared stories of Gods
getting angry, or of Gods

58
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.899 line:1
getting reborn,

59
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.499 line:1
but no matter who you were, 

60
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.699 line:1
or what stories you had, 

61
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.799 line:1
there was a question that you
were faced with:

62
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.999 line:1
when would the winter come? 

63
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.889 line:1
And it mattered that you go
beyond those stories, that you

64
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.799 line:1
actually go outside into the
world, and that you look.

65
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.489 line:1
There was a right answer about
when the darkness would come

66
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.299 line:1
and when the light would return.

67
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.799 line:1
And knowing the right answer 

68
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.699 line:1
might determine whether your
community survived.

69
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.899 line:1
Now 

70
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.699 line:1
it's not the literal
astronomical Solstice today.

71
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.899 line:1
That's a couple days away and
we're a little early.

72
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.199 line:1
But 

73
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.189 line:1
we're gathered here tonight to
face the coming darkness

74
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.099 line:1
together,

75
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.599 line:1
and how are people brought
light into the world?

76
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.689 line:1
And as we do that, we will be
undertaking a few different

77
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.799 line:1
journeys together.

78
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.199 line:1
We'll be journeying from light
to dark to light again.

79
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:33.499 line:1
And 

80
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.489 line:1
at the same time we'll be
journeying from the past to

81
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.399 line:1
the present

82
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.999 line:1
and into the future. 

83
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.799 line:1
And hopefully 

84
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.199 line:1
we'll be 

85
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.789 line:1
journeying from a little
uncomfortable singing out loud

86
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.799 line:1
in our living rooms to fully
comfortable with that.

87
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.599 line:1
If you're new, you might not
know most of the songs.

88
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:55.699 line:1
That's okay. 

89
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.699 line:1
If you don't think that you're
good at singing,

90
00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.999 line:1
that's totally fine. 

91
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.289 line:1
Solstice is about singing
together and even if you've

92
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.099 line:1
never heard a song before,
we'd love to hear you.

93
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.899 line:1
Now what concretely will happen
tonight?

94
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.099 line:1
First, 

95
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.799 line:1
this will be about 2 hours long. 

96
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.689 line:1
It will involve a lot of
singing and a lot of listening

97
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.398 line:1
to stories.

98
00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.599 line:1
On the right side of the screen
is a chat widget.

99
00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:24.789 line:1
For the first 30 minutes that
widget will be up and you can

100 line:1
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.899 line:1
chat with each other about
what's going on,

101 line:1
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.599 line:1
or catch up, or just generally
be virtual humans together.

102 line:1
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.589 line:1
But after those 30 minutes,
after we've settled in, the

103 line:1
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.599 line:1
chat will turn off.

104 line:1
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.999 line:1
And we'll begin our descent
into darkness

105 line:1
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.999 line:1
and try to get into a virtual
head space.

106 line:1
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.989 line:1
As we descend into darkness,
some of the content may make

107 line:1
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.099 line:1
you feel uncomfortable.

108 line:1
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.799 line:1
This holiday is about facing
difficult truths together.

109 line:1
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.589 line:1
But the way that we've put
together tonight's Solstice

110 line:1
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.799 line:1
doesn't have to be the way
that everyone faces it.

111 line:1
00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.499 line:1
So if you're not in a good head
space

112 line:1
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.499 line:1
to reflect on how awful reality
can be, that's okay.

113 line:1
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.689 line:1
You can take a break and come
back or you can tap out and

114 line:1
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.599 line:1
come to the after party
afterwards.

115 line:1
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.289 line:1
We'll also have a corner at the
after party for people to help

116 line:1
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.799 line:1
each other process things.

117 line:1
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.499 line:1
Now 

118 line:1
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.689 line:1
there will be speeches and
those speeches will make

119 line:1
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.499 line:1
assertions.

120 line:1
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.789 line:1
We care a lot about not saying
false things at Solstice and

121 line:1
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.199 line:1
we've put a lot of effort into
not saying false things,

122 line:1
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.899 line:1
but the universe is 

123 line:1
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.799 line:1
a messy complicated place, 

124 line:1
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.189 line:1
and we might not all believe
the exact same things about

125 line:1
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.799 line:1
how the world is or how to
relate to it.

126 line:1
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.389 line:1
So if someone says something
you don't agree with, that's

127 line:1
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.099 line:1
okay.

128 line:1
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.199 line:1
Solstice is about collectively
seeking truth together,

129 line:1
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.399 line:1
but it's okay  

130 line:1
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.299 line:1
if we're not all on the same
page at the same time.

131 line:1
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.689 line:1
Finally on a logistical note,
if you've got some candles

132 line:1
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.499 line:1
with you,

133 line:1
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.499 line:1
now is a good time to light
them.

134 line:1
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.399 line:1
Over the course of the night,
the visuals will get darker

135 line:1
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.299 line:1
and we encourage you to turn
your lights off as that happens.
