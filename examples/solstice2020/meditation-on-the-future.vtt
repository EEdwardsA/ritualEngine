The journey of humanity is not
yet over.

1
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.299 line:1
With luck, 

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.799 line:1
or more likely, dedication and
skill,

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.499 line:1
we have a long way yet to
travel.

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.389 line:1
There's a lot happening in the
present

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.199 line:1
vying for our immediate
attention.

6
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.989 line:1
But one important property that
separates us

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.099 line:1
from the other apes 

8
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.199 line:1
is our ability to plan for the
long-term.

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.188 line:1
To imagine a better world 

10
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.199 line:1
and then work to bring it into
existence.

11
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.299 line:1
So now I'd like us to take a
step back

12
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.099 line:1
aqnd think on that big picture. 

13
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.299 line:1
The future is coming, 

14
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.199 line:1
whether we are ready or not. 

15
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.099 line:1
It can be hard enough to plan
for the next week,

16
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.699 line:1
never mind the next year, 

17
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.399 line:1
never mind the next decade. 

18
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.299 line:1
But decades are only a tiny
sliver of the human story.

19
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.598 line:1
Our story is thousands, in some
ways millions, of years old.

20
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.699 line:1
And if things go well, it's
nowhere near close to done.

21
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.189 line:1
Predicting the future is
difficult and it's hard to

22
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.999 line:1
tell specific stories about it.

23
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.499 line:1
But there will be specific
things happening.

24
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.999 line:1
5000 years from now is real, 

25
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.599 line:1
just as real as 5000 years ago. 

26
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.999 line:1
So I'd like to end tonight with
a question:

27
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.499 line:1
What do you imagine? 

28
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.899 line:1
What'll have become of humanity
millennia from now?

29
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.588 line:1
The future may be strange
beyond our ability to

30
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.499 line:1
visualize, but we are not
completely blind,

31
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.099 line:1
and our ability to foresee good
or ill

32
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.399 line:1
is key to our ability to steer
the future's course.

33
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.999 line:1
So when you look ahead, 

34
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.899 line:1
what do you see? 

35
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.299 line:1
And one more question: 

36
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.999 line:1
what do you want to see? 

37
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.599 line:1
If things go well, 

38
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.599 line:1
if humanity makes it off of
this rock alive,

39
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.699 line:1
if you could nudge the universe
onto a better path,

40
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.899 line:1
with direction would you nudge
it?

41
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.999 line:1
Where are we going 

42
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.899 line:1
and who shall we become?
