It can feel overwhelming to
think about the future.

1
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.999 line:1
I don't have easy answers here. 

2
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.489 line:1
I do know it is possible to
pick oneself up in most

3
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.699 line:1
situations

4
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.599 line:1
and where I imagine most people
are at is no exception.

5
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.499 line:1
That's easy to know in theory. 

6
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.399 line:1
It's much harder 

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.499 line:1
to know the steps to get there. 

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.999 line:1
In 2018, 

9
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.599 line:1
I was living through the worst
year of my life,

10
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.099 line:1
world shattered around me. 

11
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.899 line:1
I tried a lot of things to get
out of that dark place,

12
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.599 line:1
but ultimately there wasn't any
single solution

13
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.799 line:1
given the complexity that life
is often

14
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.799 line:1
made up of. 

15
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.599 line:1
In some ways, 

16
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.199 line:1
I'm still working on getting
better.

17
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.989 line:1
And though this year has
actually been pretty good for

18
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.499 line:1
my own personal healing,

19
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.999 line:1
I still remember what it was
like back then,

20
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.599 line:1
constantly looking toward the
future,

21
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.699 line:1
dwelling in what I had lost, 

22
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.499 line:1
and feeling afraid 

23
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.499 line:1
that I wouldn't be able to make
it back.

24
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.699 line:1
During whatever period one
might call normal

25
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.189 line:1
the usual things that come to
mind when looking toward the

26
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.699 line:1
future are pretty big.

27
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.288 line:1
It can be tempting to follow
those same familiar scripts,

28
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.499 line:1
even when the world shifted.

29
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.999 line:1
What career shifts will I make? 

30
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.899 line:1
What 

31
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.099 line:1
are the next steps to
accomplish my goals?

32
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.799 line:1
How can I have an impact? 

33
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.199 line:1
But, if you're like me, 

34
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.788 line:1
when you don't have a stable
foundation, those can feel so

35
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.989 line:1
overwhelming and detached from
the current reality that you

36
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.999 line:1
feel lost.

37
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.899 line:1
The thing is, realistically, 

38
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.189 line:1
all of that big picture stuff
takes a thousand little things

39
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.899 line:1
to even work.

40
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.788 line:1
If you have grand goals, those
little things might seem

41
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.199 line:1
inconsequential by comparison.

42
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.689 line:1
You might not even notice how
important they are, how they

43
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.599 line:1
support you.

44
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.899 line:1
But these steps matter to
building a better future,

45
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.199 line:1
because maybe you can't change
the world in one night.

46
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.199 line:1
Keeping in touch with friends, 

47
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.899 line:1
getting good sleep, 

48
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.399 line:1
eating well, or 

49
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.699 line:1
you know, whatever well means
for you,

50
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.399 line:1
taking vitamin D, and watering
your plants.

51
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.499 line:1
Maybe you set aside some time
to care for the people

52
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.889 line:1
you love, to get to sleep a bit
earlier, or to finally write

53
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.699 line:1
that post that you were hoping
to all those months ago.

54
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.789 line:1
All these little things can
work towards stability and

55
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.499 line:1
strength.

56
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.799 line:1
For me, at least, that was
crucial.

57
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.499 line:1
I had to take several steps
back and take a break

58
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.399 line:1
and work on the smaller things. 

59
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.399 line:1
And it took far longer than I'd
like to admit to realize that.

60
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.599 line:1
I'd work that I wish 

61
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.599 line:1
that I'd figured out how to feel

62
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.899 line:1
okay, focusing on the little
things sooner.

63
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.999 line:1
Such that brighter futures 

64
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.599 line:1
seemed more possible. 

65
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.299 line:1
So 

66
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.899 line:1
while I can't give an exact
roadmap,

67
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.099 line:1
here's a suggestion if you're
struggling:

68
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.399 line:1
it's okay to focus on the now, 

69
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.499 line:1
on a smaller scope of what you
can do and what you can control.

70
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.599 line:1
You can think about yourself, 

71
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.399 line:1
you can think about your
friends,

72
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.599 line:1
your family, 

73
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.599 line:1
your loved ones. 

74
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.999 line:1
You can think about this next
minute,

75
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.199 line:1
this next day, 

76
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.399 line:1
this next week. 

77
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.399 line:1
Think about the smaller things
that bring you light.

78
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.699 line:1
Now, 

79
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.299 line:1
looking around, 

80
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.299 line:1
even through the limited
interface,

81
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.299 line:1
I can see a lot of people in
this room.

82
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.499 line:1
Some of us know each other 

83
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.499 line:1
pretty well. 

84
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.799 line:1
Others, 

85
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.399 line:1
maybe not so much. 

86
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.299 line:1
But regardless of how we got
here,

87
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.299 line:1
we are all here, 

88
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.599 line:1
together, 

89
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.099 line:1
celebrating the longest night
of the year.

90
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.199 line:1
There's a lot of light here. 

91
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.499 line:1
That's pretty special. 

92
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.999 line:1
Remember that.

93
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.089 line:1
And remember that many of your
peers here are fighting for

94
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.399 line:1
brighter futures, too.

95
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.999 line:1
There are futures that are
worth protecting.

96
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.898 line:1
And it's worth taking those
little steps to get to them

97
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.099 line:1
be those steps taken alone or
together.

98
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.089 line:1
So even if the light at the end
of the tunnel seems dim from

99
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.999 line:1
where you are,

100 line:1
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.199 line:1
remember that there is still a
light somewhere.

101 line:1
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.299 line:1
Remember that you are not alone 

102 line:1
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.499 line:1
in this fight. 

103 line:1
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.499 line:1
Though we can't be together
physically,

104 line:1
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.199 line:1
or working on the same things
in each moment,

105 line:1
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.699 line:1
we can at least be together in
spirit.

106 line:1
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.399 line:1
To borrow from another Solstice
speech,

107 line:1
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.899 line:1
we are each a part of the story
of humanity.

108 line:1
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.589 line:1
Our pursuit of truth, our
pursuit of meaning, and our

109 line:1
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.699 line:1
pursuit of happiness,

110 line:1
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.299 line:1
in some ways 

111 line:1
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.799 line:1
they are incredibly fragile. 

112 line:1
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.699 line:1
But compared to any one of us, 

113 line:1
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.899 line:1
they are incredibly difficult
to extinguish.

114 line:1
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.899 line:1
We, the people here tonight,
and the people on this planet,

115 line:1
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.499 line:1
we have the power to shape our
stories,

116 line:1
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.799 line:1
to bring light to their
darkness,

117 line:1
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.699 line:1
and to guide them into the
future.

118 line:1
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.099 line:1
Together, 

119 line:1
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.799 line:1
we can bring light. 

120 line:1
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.599 line:1
We will find a way through this.
