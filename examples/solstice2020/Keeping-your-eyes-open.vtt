I wish I could see you all
right now,

1
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.989 line:1
but I'm just going to pretend
that you're out there

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.399 line:1
somewhere behind my computer.

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.699 line:1
So two years ago at Solstice, 

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.099 line:1
I told the story about an old
man who had a lodge

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.599 line:1
at Mount Saint Helens. 

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.499 line:1
And when the mountain was about
to blow,

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.399 line:1
he really just couldn't bring
himself to believe

8
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.899 line:1
that he was about to lose
everything,

9
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.499 line:1
that this could really happen. 

10
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.699 line:1
So he stayed. 

11
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.299 line:1
And he went down with his cabin. 

12
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.899 line:1
I really hoped that our
community would be different,

13
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.899 line:1
that when science pointed to an
impending disaster of some kind,

14
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.999 line:1
we would notice and take action. 

15
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.289 line:1
So then, beginning of this year,
there's a novel coronavirus

16
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.199 line:1
in Wuhan, it's spreading. And a
lot of media in the US,

17
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.589 line:1
January and February, are
saying that

18
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.199 line:1
it's not a big deal, don't
panic,

19
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.299 line:1
you have more to be concerned
about from the flu.

20
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.599 line:1
And we just didn't buy it. 

21
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.099 line:1
People in this community really
didn't buy it.

22
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.389 line:1
People looked around and saw a
lot of evidence

23
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.199 line:1
that, no, this thing was
spreading

24
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.699 line:1
in a lot of different countries. 

25
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.199 line:1
The infection fatality rate, 

26
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.389 line:1
well we didn't know what it was
exactly,

27
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.199 line:1
but it looks significantly
worse than the flu.

28
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.999 line:1
And people spoke up. 

29
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.999 line:1
And we acted, and we 

30
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.788 line:1
bought toilet paper and we told
our parents to buy toilet paper

31
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.299 line:1
and to go buy masks and food and 

32
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.199 line:1
we didn't know what was going
to happen exactly, but

33
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.499 line:1
we knew that there was
something to be prepared for.

34
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.689 line:1
And I think as this unfold,
unfolded, we tried our best to

35
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.399 line:1
apply

36
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.299 line:1
the tools we had to this
problem.

37
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.989 line:1
To basically go through the
literature and try to figure

38
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.889 line:1
out infection dynamics,

39
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.699 line:1
try to figure out how to
protect ourselves,

40
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.399 line:1
I just saw so much organization, 

41
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.288 line:1
people on Facebook groups, on
Less Wrong, people organizing

42
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.499 line:1
Zoom calls,

43
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.899 line:1
to try to make sense of what
was happening.

44
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.389 line:1
And you know, there were some
interesting epistemic

45
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.989 line:1
challenges. The CDC, early on,
said that masks

46
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.789 line:1
there's no evidence that masks
were effective at preventing

47
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.799 line:1
transmission.

48
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.989 line:1
And I remember talking with
people about this and thinking

49
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.899 line:1
about, you know, what evidence
we did have.

50
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.289 line:1
And I think at the end of the
day, most people did go out

51
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.599 line:1
and they bought N95s and they
wore them.

52
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.099 line:1
This community is no stranger
to global catastrophes.

53
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.699 line:1
And I think there's something
to that, right?

54
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.799 line:1
Artificial general intelligence,
nuclear war,

55
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.299 line:1
engineered pandemics. 

56
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.499 line:1
In some ways, we should be good
at this.

57
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.499 line:1
This is our wheelhouse. 

58
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.899 line:1
And I really like this
community.

59
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.999 line:1
And I like that we don't just 

60
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.499 line:1
think about how to know what's
true.

61
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.199 line:1
We actually believe that true
things can be figured out.

62
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.199 line:1
And that 

63
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.489 line:1
yeah, the world's complex and
messy and, no, not always

64
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.399 line:1
amenable to randomized
controlled clinical trials,

65
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.299 line:1
but we can still reduce our
uncertainty.

66
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.599 line:1
This year was pretty
significant to me.

67
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.099 line:1
Not just because it was, like,
weird and bad and

68
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.599 line:1
strange. 

69
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.199 line:1
And not just because I was
worried about

70
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.599 line:1
my friends and family and
grandparents.

71
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.399 line:1
This year was meaningful to me
because

72
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.499 line:1
it really did present 

73
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.399 line:1
I think, a really important
opportunity,

74
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.789 line:1
an opportunity to learn from,
like,

75
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.399 line:1
a live unfolding catastrophe, 

76
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.999 line:1
a global pandemic, 

77
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.989 line:1
one on a scale that hadn't
happened in my parent's

78
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.999 line:1
generation or my grandparent's
generation.

79
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.599 line:1
And 

80
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.789 line:1
I just really don't want to
pass up an opportunity to

81
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.899 line:1
learn from that.

82
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.399 line:1
Like, I want to know how well
we did.

83
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.099 line:1
I want to know how well I did, 

84
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.899 line:1
how well the rationality
community did,

85
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.499 line:1
how well our public health
departments did,

86
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.399 line:1
governments, our own, others, 

87
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.799 line:1
and our whole civilization, our
whole species.

88
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.199 line:1
I'm 

89
00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.699 line:1
pretty happy 

90
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.699 line:1
that 

91
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.299 line:1
our community recognized 

92
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.099 line:1
this early on, for the most
part, and took it seriously.

93
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.989 line:1
Which isn't to say we didn't
make any mistakes, I think we

94
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.399 line:1
made some significant mistakes,

95
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.299 line:1
I know I made some. 

96
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.299 line:1
But I think at the end of the
day,

97
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.199 line:1
I'm just pretty proud that 

98
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.099 line:1
people 

99
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.999 line:1
fought this thing with our eyes
open,

100 line:1
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.299 line:1
and that we didn't blink when
the storm hit.

101 line:1
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.099 line:1
I can't say the same for our
federal government.

102 line:1
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.599 line:1
I think that they really fumbled 

103 line:1
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.099 line:1
some of the early response. 

104 line:1
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.999 line:1
The CDC with their early tests
that didn't work,

105 line:1
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.389 line:1
and then the FDA when they
didn't let universities use

106 line:1
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.799 line:1
the tests they already had,

107 line:1
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.099 line:1
so that we were blind to the
extent that the coronavirus

108 line:1
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.599 line:1
was spreading in our country.

109 line:1
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.399 line:1
A lot of mistakes were made. 

110 line:1
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.599 line:1
And coordination is hard. 

111 line:1
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.799 line:1
Risk assessment is hard. 

112 line:1
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.399 line:1
Public health policy in a
chaotic

113 line:1
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.799 line:1
aging bureaucracy is pretty
hard.

114 line:1
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.199 line:1
But if I step back a little bit
and think about how we did

115 line:1
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.299 line:1
as a whole world, as a whole
species,

116 line:1
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.699 line:1
then 

117 line:1
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.199 line:1
I think we're doing pretty well. 

118 line:1
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.299 line:1
It used to be 

119 line:1
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.499 line:1
that a pandemic 

120 line:1
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.999 line:1
was a bizarre hand 

121 line:1
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.899 line:1
of a mad angry God. 

122 line:1
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.099 line:1
But now 

123 line:1
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.499 line:1
a pandemic 

124 line:1
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.299 line:1
usually is caused by a virus. 

125 line:1
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:19.299 line:1
Right? 

126 line:1
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.899 line:1
And it has a spike protein, 

127 line:1
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.089 line:1
and the spike protein binds
well with certain human cell

128 line:1
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.099 line:1
receptors,

129 line:1
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.989 line:1
and, you know, we figured out
that if you can inject some

130 line:1
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.989 line:1
RNA into some people and you
can sort of get those cells to

131 line:1
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.499 line:1
produce some bits that can

132 line:1
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.899 line:1
train the immune system to
produce some other bits,

133 line:1
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.289 line:1
those bits can bind to the part
of the virus

134 line:1
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.389 line:1
with these receptors, and
basically you can stop

135 line:1
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.899 line:1
infection in its tracks. Like,
we can do that now.

136 line:1
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.599 line:1
That's pretty cool. 

137 line:1
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.799 line:1
And like yeah, 

138 line:1
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.299 line:1
we could have probably produced
and tested a vaccine faster,

139 line:1
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.299 line:1
but the fact remains that 

140 line:1
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.899 line:1
never before in human history
have we ever produced

141 line:1
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.989 line:1
so many doses of vaccine and
tested them in such a short

142 line:1
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.999 line:1
period of time.

143 line:1
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.099 line:1
And I think it's good that
we've come a long way, because

144 line:1
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.199 line:1
I think we have a long way to
go.

145 line:1
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.099 line:1
We beat smallpox because we
learned how it worked.

146 line:1
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.799 line:1
And how it could be stopped. 

147 line:1
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.089 line:1
And the story is roughly the
same with COVID, except that

148 line:1
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.599 line:1
we learned faster and better.

149 line:1
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.399 line:1
And I think that future
challenges are going to be

150 line:1
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.999 line:1
harder, maybe a lot harder, 

151 line:1
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.699 line:1
and that some of them 

152 line:1
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.989 line:1
aren't going to give us good
feedback in the same way that

153 line:1
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.399 line:1
these gave us good feedback,

154 line:1
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.789 line:1
and for some of them 

155 line:1
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.699 line:1
there won't be any second
chances at all.

156 line:1
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.799 line:1
So I say let's take this
opportunity,

157 line:1
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.899 line:1
while we have it, to learn,
this year.

158 line:1
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.199 line:1
And let's notice our mistakes,
and our confusions, and the

159 line:1
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.399 line:1
things we failed to predict.

160 line:1
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.399 line:1
And at the same time, let's be
proud of each other,

161 line:1
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.399 line:1
and let's notice where we did
well,

162 line:1
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.299 line:1
and where we learned, and where
we grew.

163 line:1
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.999 line:1
I'm certainly proud of you all, 

164 line:1
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.999 line:1
not just for getting through
this,

165 line:1
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.799 line:1
but for staying curious 

166 line:1
00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.499 line:1
and keeping your eyes open.
