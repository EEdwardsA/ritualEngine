Every year 

1
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.489 line:1
we gather and think about many
different themes that are

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.499 line:1
important to us.

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.699 line:1
We think about the very good 

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.799 line:1
and 

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.099 line:1
the very bad. 

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.799 line:1
We think about humanity's past. 

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.799 line:1
We sing Bitter Wind Blown 

8
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.388 line:1
and reflect on what it would be
like to have to light our own

9
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.599 line:1
fires for warmth.

10
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.589 line:1
We try to imagine what it would
feel like not to know why it

11
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.599 line:1
gets cold

12
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.199 line:1
or why we get sick 

13
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.199 line:1
or whether there is anything we
can do about it.

14
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.899 line:1
We think about the present. 

15
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.489 line:1
We share stories of humanity's
astonishing technological

16
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.999 line:1
accomplishments

17
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.999 line:1
and feats of cooperation over
the last five thousand years.

18
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.289 line:1
And sometimes we think about
the present

19
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.599 line:1
from another perspective. 

20
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.599 line:1
Beside our achievements, 

21
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.299 line:1
we see stretching from the past
into the present

22
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.599 line:1
an unbroken thread of suffering, 

23
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.099 line:1
woven thick with the
experiences of countless souls.

24
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.299 line:1
So at the same time, 

25
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.588 line:1
we must contend with the fact
that we are standing on a

26
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.599 line:1
rising pedestal,

27
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.599 line:1
flung exponentially higher by
our ancestors,

28
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.999 line:1
and that also, 

29
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.499 line:1
all around us, 

30
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.199 line:1
unacceptable atrocities
continue.

31
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.099 line:1
How are we to make sense of
this?

32
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.699 line:1
When confronted with the desire
to understand everything and

33
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.399 line:1
the compulsion to ensure the
prosperity of the far future,

34
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.588 line:1
how are we to stretch our minds
across both the enormous losses

35
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.699 line:1
and enormous gains?

36
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.599 line:1
This is a challenge that is
with us in normal times.

37
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.099 line:1
This last year 

38
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.499 line:1
has brought a further
complication to the picture.

39
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.299 line:1
With pervasive fear of sickness, 

40
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.788 line:1
stuttering economies, and our
institutions struggling to

41
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.099 line:1
keep their heads above the
water,

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.599 line:1
it no longer feels like we are
at the apex of human history.

43
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.899 line:1
To better understand these
extremes,

44
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.299 line:1
we need to deploy the tools of
rationality.

45
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.999 line:1
In the third century before the
common era,

46
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.399 line:1
a man named Archimedes wrote an
essay called The Sand Reckoner.

47
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.989 line:1
The ancient Greeks, you see, 

48
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.799 line:1
had a term for a large quantity: 

49
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.599 line:1
a "sand hundred". 

50
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.389 line:1
The idea was that although you
could

51
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.589 line:1
one could see with the naked
eye that sand consisted of

52
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.699 line:1
discrete grains,

53
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.099 line:1
enumerating all the grains in a
sand dune,

54
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.599 line:1
let alone an entire desert, was
beyond possibility.

55
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.699 line:1
Beyond human abilities. 

56
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.999 line:1
But the mind of Archimedes 

57
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.399 line:1
soared above such imagined
limitations.

58
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.399 line:1
He invented a means of
manipulating large numbers,

59
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.699 line:1
which today we would call
exponents,

60
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.899 line:1
and with these he calculated
the upper bounds

61
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.989 line:1
on the number of sand grains in
the whole of the earth,

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.899 line:1
and indeed, 

63
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.799 line:1
sand grain volume of the entire
universe

64
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.799 line:1
as they believed it to be at
the time.

65
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.499 line:1
In this exercise, 

66
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.699 line:1
Archimedes had reckoned the
sand.

67
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.099 line:1
And in bringing the immensity
of the sand inside himself,

68
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.899 line:1
he also unleashed the mind of
humanity

69
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.299 line:1
onto the universe. 

70
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.799 line:1
One virtue of rationality is
precision.

71
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.999 line:1
And sometimes precision is less
about knowing decimal places,

72
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.199 line:1
and more about knowing what
order of magnitude you're on.

73
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.099 line:1
Another virtue of rationality
is scholarship.

74
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.999 line:1
And the way that I know how to
reckon with today's immensities

75
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.099 line:1
is to do research and find
statistics

76
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.499 line:1
that tell me something 

77
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.399 line:1
about what order of magnitude
we're on.

78
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.799 line:1
For example, 

79
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.099 line:1
the Spanish flu of 1918 

80
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.399 line:1
killed somewhere between twenty
and a hundred million people.

81
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.089 line:1
For comparison, malaria kills
about half a million people

82
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.899 line:1
per year,

83
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.099 line:1
and COVID has killed 1.7
million people.

84
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.399 line:1
In the second quarter of this
year,

85
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.299 line:1
the US GDP had the largest
decline on record,

86
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.999 line:1
and then the third quarter had
the largest increase on record,

87
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.399 line:1
although the net of those was
still negative.

88
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.199 line:1
It took us 

89
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.099 line:1
about a year to develop and
begin distributing a vaccine

90
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.199 line:1
for COVID.

91
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.999 line:1
The previous fastest vaccine 

92
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.199 line:1
took about four years to
develop, in 1967.

93
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.299 line:1
These facts can be objects of
meditation.

94
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.289 line:1
They can be devices in your
practice to understand the

95
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.299 line:1
world around you,

96
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.699 line:1
to orient your mind, 

97
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.599 line:1
and to choose future actions. 

98
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.799 line:1
Despite the clarity of specific
numbers,

99
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.189 line:1
it can take a long time 

100 line:1
00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.799 line:1
to really understand what they
mean.

101 line:1
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.489 line:1
A lot of exposure is necessary 

102 line:1
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.599 line:1
to take these numbers inside
yourself.

103 line:1
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.099 line:1
My recommendation 

104 line:1
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.499 line:1
is to think about it lightly
often,

105 line:1
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.999 line:1
and deeply on occasion. 

106 line:1
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.999 line:1
To think about it lightly often, 

107 line:1
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.199 line:1
perhaps form some associations
that will let you be

108 line:1
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.999 line:1
incidentally reminded of the
good and the bad.

109 line:1
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.099 line:1
For example, 

110 line:1
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.999 line:1
whenever I see a plane in the
sky,

111 line:1
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.599 line:1
I just can't help but stop for
a second,

112 line:1
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.299 line:1
and follow its path through the
sky with my eyes,

113 line:1
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.699 line:1
and imagine all the people on
board.

114 line:1
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.999 line:1
It is truly a miracle that for
a modest sum,

115 line:1
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:40.799 line:1
each of those people 

116 line:1
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.799 line:1
can be safely hurled across the
surface of this great Earth,

117 line:1
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.199 line:1
and in the meantime 

118 line:1
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.599 line:1
admire the tops of clouds. 

119 line:1
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.499 line:1
In contrast, 

120 line:1
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.799 line:1
whenever I walk down the street
and see a padlock,

121 line:1
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.089 line:1
it reminds me that we have
failed to solve basic

122 line:1
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.199 line:1
coordination problems between
people.

123 line:1
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.289 line:1
While there still exist wars
and police,

124 line:1
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.099 line:1
or even fences and padlocks, 

125 line:1
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.299 line:1
we have not yet finished our
work.

126 line:1
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.899 line:1
This is a careful balancing
game.

127 line:1
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.389 line:1
You don't want to be so often
optimistic that you lose your

128 line:1
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.199 line:1
sense of urgency in building
the future,

129 line:1
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.689 line:1
and you don't want to be so
despondent that you lose your

130 line:1
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.499 line:1
will to try.

131 line:1
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.999 line:1
Minds vary in their makeup, 

132 line:1
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.699 line:1
so experiment at your own
discretion.

133 line:1
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.799 line:1
For me, 

134 line:1
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.099 line:1
these associations are a light
reminder,

135 line:1
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.999 line:1
almost a subconscious one, 

136 line:1
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.199 line:1
which give me 

137 line:1
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.599 line:1
the opportunity to choose 

138 line:1
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.999 line:1
how deeply I want to reflect. 

139 line:1
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.589 line:1
The more you traverse the
orders of magnitude,

140 line:1
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.899 line:1
the more familiar they become, 

141 line:1
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.789 line:1
and the more you will be
oriented to

142 line:1
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.199 line:1
the exponential reality. 

143 line:1
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.599 line:1
And tonight 

144 line:1
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.199 line:1
is a time to consider it more
deeply.

145 line:1
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.799 line:1
So for now, 

146 line:1
00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.699 line:1
I will leave you with one more
statistic

147 line:1
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.699 line:1
on which to reflect in silence 

148 line:1
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.099 line:1
for the next minute. 

149 line:1
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:07.799 line:1
The global death rate 

150 line:1
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.199 line:1
is about 107 people every
minute,
