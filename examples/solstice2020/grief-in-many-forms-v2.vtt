There are some emotions that it
feels like our society has

1
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.299 line:1
reasonable scripts for dealing
with.

2
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.399 line:1
But in my experience, 

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.199 line:1
grief has never really been
among them,

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.989 line:1
particularly for those of us
who don't believe in any

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.799 line:1
divinity or afterlife.

6
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.699 line:1
We come back to the same canned
platitudes,

7
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.399 line:1
like "I'm sorry for your loss",

8
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.499 line:1
because so much of what lies
outside of those safe rote lines

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.089 line:1
feels like it's in danger of
slipping off one side of a

10
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.999 line:1
knife edge.

11
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.099 line:1
On one hand, it seems
unspeakably cruel

12
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.899 line:1
to reinforce someone's sense of
despair,

13
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.589 line:1
to tell themselves that their
darkest voices about their

14
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.599 line:1
life are right.

15
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.999 line:1
But positivity and optimism
feel false, even insulting:

16
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.799 line:1
hope we have no right to give.

17
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.099 line:1
Sadness and anger at least have
their roots in the world

18
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.399 line:1
that still is.

19
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.799 line:1
Grief is the acute awareness of
an absence,

20
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.099 line:1
something or someone ripped
from the fabric of your life.

21
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.099 line:1
Grief can destabilize, 

22
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.699 line:1
can feel like trying to learn
how to walk after an amputation.

23
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.989 line:1
With every step your muscle
memory tries to lean back into

24
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.699 line:1
the limb that isn't there,

25
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.899 line:1
and you wobble on, trying to
find some new balance.

26
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.299 line:1
You can't tell someone that an
absence will be filled again,

27
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.499 line:1
because it probably won't be,

28
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.099 line:1
not perfectly.

29
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.499 line:1
There will always be nooks and
crannies that stay empty,

30
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.399 line:1
even with our best efforts. 

31
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.999 line:1
We can't say that it will
eventually get better,

32
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.299 line:1
because broken things don't
always get rebuilt

33
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.499 line:1
and things we lose sometimes
just stay lost.

34
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.099 line:1
A year and a half ago a good
friend of mine died suddenly.

35
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.399 line:1
I was far from the hardest hit
by their death,

36
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.199 line:1
but it did give me a painfully
close encounter with grief.

37
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.499 line:1
When I heard 

38
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.189 line:1
it felt like the universe had
suddenly shuddered into an

39
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.199 line:1
unthinkable incoherent
trajectory.

40
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.299 line:1
Parts of my life that had
entwined themselves around them

41
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.299 line:1
were unquestioned solidity one
minute,

42
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.699 line:1
and completely gone the next. 

43
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.889 line:1
This year I think many of us
have become acquainted with a

44
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.199 line:1
broader palette of grief and
loss

45
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.699 line:1
than we ever thought we would
have to experience.

46
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.389 line:1
Grief for human life is
horrible and wrenching and

47
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.799 line:1
intense and one of the worst
feelings we have to endure.

48
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.599 line:1
But on some basic level, it's
something I expected

49
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.999 line:1
I would have to face someday,

50
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.599 line:1
part of the biological contract
with mortality.

51
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.399 line:1
Growing up,

52
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.389 line:1
I never considered what it
would feel like to feel grief

53
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.699 line:1
for normality itself.

54
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.899 line:1
To an even greater extent than
the more

55
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.299 line:1
expected forms of grief,

56
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.899 line:1
it's something that feels hard
to talk about with the nuance

57
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:13.799 line:1
it deserves. 

58
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.699 line:1
This is a grief we have even
less of a language for.

59
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.999 line:1
This year, 

60
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.799 line:1
so many parts of my life, big
and small,

61
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.099 line:1
have turned into aching
absences.

62
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.299 line:1
I imagine the same is true for
many of you.

63
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.599 line:1
Late night conversations at
crowded parties,

64
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.889 line:1
leaning your head on a friend's
shoulder

65
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.199 line:1
without thinking about it. 

66
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.289 line:1
The uncomplicated certainty of
knowing you'll see your family

67
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.299 line:1
at the holidays.

68
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.189 line:1
The tingling excitement of
stepping onto an airplane

69
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.999 line:1
going somewhere new,

70
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.089 line:1
without having to worry about 

71
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.799 line:1
how tightly your mask is
fitting.

72
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.589 line:1
Social institutions you've
invested in and cared deeply

73
00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.899 line:1
about

74
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.499 line:1
that simply can't translate to
the digital.

75
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.099 line:1
Communities that used to be
full of warmth and dynamism,

76
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.299 line:1
now 

77
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.289 line:1
ghostly remnants trying to
subsist on the forms of

78
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.499 line:1
connection that remain.

79
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.089 line:1
When I look at my own life, it
can be hard to even account

80
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.199 line:1
for all of the things I've lost.

81
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.699 line:1
Since some days

82
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.199 line:1
it feels like my world 

83
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.699 line:1
is filled up more by the empty
spaces left behind

84
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.599 line:1
than by the things I have
managed to cling on to.

85
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.299 line:1
And I know it's probably the
case

86
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.999 line:1
that we've not lost all of
these things permanently.

87
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.889 line:1
But we don't really know yet
what the world will look like

88
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.999 line:1
after this.

89
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.999 line:1
This 

90
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.699 line:1
is loss,

91
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.689 line:1
and what I felt for all of
those little experiences of

92
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.799 line:1
normality was grief,

93
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.999 line:1
but it took me a while to
acknowledge that to myself.

94
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.289 line:1
It felt stupid 

95
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.599 line:1
and insignificant and
unbelievably selfish

96
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.299 line:1
to put the loss I felt for
these small joys and wonders

97
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.499 line:1
even in the same category as
the loss of human life.

98
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.899 line:1
Who was I to claim to be
grieving?

99
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:07.899 line:1
I asked myself. 

100 line:1
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.199 line:1
I hadn't even known anyone who
had died in the pandemic.

101 line:1
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.599 line:1
They were the only ones who had
the right to that emotion.

102 line:1
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.699 line:1
But there is not some 

103 line:1
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.399 line:1
fixed pool of grief in the world 

104 line:1
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.699 line:1
that my taking the emotional
frame

105 line:1
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.699 line:1
robs it from someone who needs
it more.

106 line:1
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.699 line:1
In my non-theological view of
things,

107 line:1
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.289 line:1
there are no spirits watching 

108 line:1
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.099 line:1
to be offended by the
comparison.

109 line:1
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.399 line:1
There are just people, 

110 line:1
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.799 line:1
trying to put their worlds back
together.

111 line:1
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.199 line:1
Grief is for the living. 

112 line:1
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.989 line:1
And we can all mourn our
different forms of brokenness

113 line:1
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.099 line:1
together,

114 line:1
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.589 line:1
without that implying a claim 

115 line:1
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.599 line:1
that our losses are equal in
magnitude.

116 line:1
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.799 line:1
Because telling ourselves that
what we lost

117 line:1
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.999 line:1
was trivial in some cosmic
objective sense

118 line:1
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.499 line:1
is unnecessary cruelty, 

119 line:1
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.799 line:1
when we know it wasn't trivial
for us.

120 line:1
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.789 line:1
For me, the hardest part of
processing my grief for the

121 line:1
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.799 line:1
world as it was before this year

122 line:1
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.099 line:1
has been 

123 line:1
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.699 line:1
convincing myself to remember
how things were

124 line:1
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.099 line:1
but to not be consumed by that
remembering.

125 line:1
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.189 line:1
It can be hard for me to choose
to conjure up

126 line:1
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.999 line:1
the bright colors of the past, 

127 line:1
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.689 line:1
when I know that doing so will
make the pain of returning to

128 line:1
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.299 line:1
the muted, grey affordances of
today

129 line:1
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:30.699 line:1
even more stark. 

130 line:1
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.889 line:1
It can feel easier to just
forget what community really

131 line:1
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:35.799 line:1
felt like.

132 line:1
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.199 line:1
What excitement felt like. 

133 line:1
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.499 line:1
What optimism felt like. 

134 line:1
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.999 line:1
Because the less I remember
them,

135 line:1
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.099 line:1
the less I'll have to feel the
weight of their absence,

136 line:1
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.599 line:1
the massive outlines in my life
where they used to be.

137 line:1
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.689 line:1
The less I'll be overwhelmed
into paralysis by the

138 line:1
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.399 line:1
magnitude of that loss.

139 line:1
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.499 line:1
It's really 

140 line:1
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.899 line:1
really tempting to just shut it
all out.

141 line:1
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.299 line:1
But I worry that if I do shut
those memories out,

142 line:1
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.799 line:1
I'll curl myself up so small 

143 line:1
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.899 line:1
to fit what's left of the world, 

144 line:1
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.799 line:1
and become too used to only
inhabiting that smallness.

145 line:1
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.999 line:1
And that when the world opens
up again,

146 line:1
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.599 line:1
and there's room for good
things to grow,

147 line:1
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.799 line:1
I'll have lost the muscle memory 

148 line:1
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.699 line:1
I would need 

149 line:1
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.299 line:1
to inhabit the spaciousness of
that possibility,

150 line:1
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.389 line:1
to fill the newfound space with
ambitious and valuable and

151 line:1
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.599 line:1
lovely things.

152 line:1
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.699 line:1
To plant seeds in a garden 

153 line:1
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.889 line:1
I may not get to see grow as
strong as it was before the

154 line:1
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:38.799 line:1
world broke.

155 line:1
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.699 line:1
And, at least for me, 

156 line:1
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.489 line:1
I think rebuilding will mean
somehow keeping my memories of

157 line:1
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.889 line:1
the good things alive and
real-feeling long enough for

158 line:1
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.789 line:1
them to give me a blueprint
for the institutions and

159 line:1
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.499 line:1
connections and investments

160 line:1
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.899 line:1
I'll want to bring back into
the world someday.

161 line:1
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.599 line:1
Even though it hurts to go back
to grey

162 line:1
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.899 line:1
after remembering a world of
color.

163 line:1
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.899 line:1
If it feels right for you, 

164 line:1
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.299 line:1
take 15 seconds now 

165 line:1
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.299 line:1
to really remember 

166 line:1
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.789 line:1
what some of the good things
that this year has taken away

167 line:1
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.999 line:1
felt like.

168 line:1
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:30.999 line:1
Ultimately, 

169 line:1
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.999 line:1
our obligation is to the future. 

170 line:1
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.599 line:1
Sometimes fulfilling that
obligation means

171 line:1
00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:39.099 line:1
stoking a fire ever higher, 

172 line:1
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.298 line:1
giving it fuel to light the
night.

173 line:1
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.899 line:1
But sometimes it means 

174 line:1
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.099 line:1
finding a few embers amidst the
ashes,

175 line:1
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.889 line:1
and keeping them safe 

176 line:1
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.899 line:1
until they can light a new
batch of kindling.

177 line:1
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.099 line:1
Even if the embers won't be
enough to really keep you warm.

178 line:1
00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.099 line:1
And in the meantime, 

179 line:1
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.199 line:1
all you'll have is the memory
of fire.
