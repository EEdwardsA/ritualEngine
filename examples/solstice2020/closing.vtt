Thank you to the programmers
who put this whole crazy app

3
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.399 line:1
together over the past few
months.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.299 line:1
Thank you to all the musicians
and speake speakers who

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.688 line:1
worked really hard putting
together videos and songs in

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.499 line:1
this new weird format.

Thank you Alex and Laura for
putting a huge amounts of work

8
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.799 line:1
over the entire year.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.299 line:1
It was really great to work
with both of you.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.688 line:1
And I just want to close things
up with one final little poem

11
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.999 line:1
you can just speak aloud in
your room if you're into it.

12
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.099 line:1
The road to wisdom,

13
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.899 line:1
Well, it's plain and simple to
express.

14
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.299 line:1
We err, and err, and err some
more,

15
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.799 line:1
but less, and less, and less. 

16
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.799 line:1
Thank you.
