    "Sun barely rising above the horizon",

    "Good folk are gonna die, sun-god ain't shedding tears",

    " ",
    "Sun, sailing away",
    "I don't know where… I don’t know why…",

    "Maybe if we looked a while and found a stone",

    " ",
    "We could dig us a henge, raise those bluestones up high",

    "And our children would know when the winter was coming, oh",
