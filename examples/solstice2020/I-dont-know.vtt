The virtue of darkness 

1
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.799 line:1
is to face reality at its
harshest without looking away.

2
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.489 line:1
There are many forms of
darkness, but perhaps the most

3
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.899 line:1
primal is to not know things.

4
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.399 line:1
Humans crave certainty. 

5
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.799 line:1
Is there a lion lurking in the
shadows or not?

6
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.299 line:1
Will your family abandon you 

7
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.399 line:1
or not? 

8
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.688 line:1
Will your parents or government
or God somehow make sure that

9
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.099 line:1
everything will ultimately be
okay?

10
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.689 line:1
And sometimes the answer is no,
you're on your own and that's

11
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.499 line:1
awful.

12
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.899 line:1
But 

13
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.299 line:1
at least you know where you
stand.

14
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.199 line:1
Sometimes though 

15
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.499 line:1
the answer is just "I don't
know".

16
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.689 line:1
And you have to make a decision
and take action without knowing,

17
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.689 line:1
and you might have to make
trade-offs or sacrifices and

18
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.589 line:1
you won't find out tomorrow or
next week or even a year from

19
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.899 line:1
now whether those sacrifices
were worth it.

20
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.699 line:1
This year there were a lot of
things

21
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.299 line:1
I didn't know. 

22
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.109 line:1
Some of them were concrete and
easy to think about.

23
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.088 line:1
How easily does COVID spread?
How likely am I to die or

24
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.599 line:1
suffer long-term debilitating
effects? Do masks work?

25
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.899 line:1
What distances can we safely
see each other outdoors?

26
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.799 line:1
Back in April the answer to
most of these was

27
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.299 line:1
"we don't know yet". 

28
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.088 line:1
And we had to make calls about
what to do, regardless, and

29
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.899 line:1
nine months later

30
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.689 line:1
some of the answers still
aren't quite as clear as I

31
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.299 line:1
would like.

32
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.399 line:1
But those were the
straightforward questions.

33
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.099 line:1
Some questions got murkier, 

34
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.389 line:1
questions about what other
people believe,

35
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.788 line:1
questions about game theory and
moral uncertainty and how to

36
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.099 line:1
handle scarcity.

37
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.889 line:1
And I didn't know the answers,
and I didn't know what other

38
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.699 line:1
people thought the answers were.

39
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.389 line:1
How dangerous do other people
think that COVID is?

40
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.288 line:1
What norms do they think there
should be in a pandemic and

41
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.599 line:1
how do they think we should
enforce those norms?

42
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.199 line:1
I don't know. 

43
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.599 line:1
What crumbling pillars of my
life do I need to survive?

44
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.299 line:1
Which pillars do my loved ones
need?

45
00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.089 line:1
If my spouse or housemate or
friends or coworkers disagree

46
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.399 line:1
about how to coordinate, what
happens?

47
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.599 line:1
I don't know. 

48
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.799 line:1
How do I feel about that? 

49
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.999 line:1
I'm not sure. 

50
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.199 line:1
If I say "screw it, I'm sick of
living in fear,

51
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.699 line:1
I'm just going to live my life
normally",

52
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.599 line:1
how likely am I to give COVID
to someone else?

53
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.999 line:1
If I decide "screw it, I'm sick
of negotiating with everyone,

54
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.789 line:1
I'm running away to the woods",
what pieces of infrastructure

55
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.599 line:1
will crumble a little bit in
my absence?

56
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.599 line:1
Which friends needed me? 

57
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.999 line:1
How many other people will run
away into the woods,

58
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.599 line:1
and what will we leave behind? 

59
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.499 line:1
I don't know. 

60
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.289 line:1
If I'm overwhelmed and alone
and don't have the skills to

61
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.299 line:1
do the right thing,

62
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.999 line:1
which mistakes can I get away
with making?

63
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.699 line:1
If a friend is overwhelmed and
alone and they hurt me,

64
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.399 line:1
how do I feel about that? 

65
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.689 line:1
If I hurt a friend because I
thought carefully and soberly

66
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.389 line:1
through the trade-offs and
wrung my hands, but ultimately

67
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.099 line:1
decided they were on the wrong
side of a trolley problem,

68
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.599 line:1
how do I feel about that? 

69
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.099 line:1
I don't know. 

70
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.199 line:1
It's the end of the year, 

71
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.799 line:1
and here we are. 

72
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.889 line:1
And it's a reasonable time to
want to make sense of things,

73
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.189 line:1
to put the year in perspective,
to ask "which sacrifices were

74
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.999 line:1
worth it"?

75
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.289 line:1
And it's a reasonable time to
want to remind ourselves that

76
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.799 line:1
we're all on the same team

77
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.599 line:1
and put the year behind us. 

78
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.589 line:1
And ultimately I do think we're
all on the same team, and I

79
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.789 line:1
have guesses about which
sacrifices were worth it and

80
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.999 line:1
which were not, but

81
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.789 line:1
the fact is I'm not nearly
confident about any of that to

82
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.999 line:1
justify giving it in a Solstice
speech.

83
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.499 line:1
And it's a complicated question
to ask,

84
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.589 line:1
what does it mean for us to all
be on the same team if we have

85
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.889 line:1
different needs and values and
beliefs about what the right

86
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.099 line:1
thing to do is?

87
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.099 line:1
I hurt people this year. 

88
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.589 line:1
And I don't know yet, which of
those were mistakes and which

89
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.889 line:1
of them were the least bad
choice I could find at the

90
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.189 line:1
time, and which of them were
actually just the right

91
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.099 line:1
decision, and I'm sorry.

92
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.099 line:1
I know other people who hurt
each other,

93
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.799 line:1
and who were quietly abandoned. 

94
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.889 line:1
And the question looms, how do
we make sense of all of that

95
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.489 line:1
and find meaning, and be a
community, and I wanted to

96
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.689 line:1
have an answer for you guys
tonight and I thought about it

97
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.099 line:1
really hard and I tried.

98
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.699 line:1
But I don't know 

99
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.799 line:1
yet. 

100 line:1
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.989 line:1
This isn't a tribe about
getting to confidently know

101 line:1
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.099 line:1
things together.

102 line:1
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.099 line:1
This is a tribe about figuring
things out.

103 line:1
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.299 line:1
Sometimes we need to walk
through the darkness a while.

104 line:1
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.799 line:1
Neither entirely alone, but not
entirely together.

105 line:1
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.999 line:1
With miles to go before morning.
