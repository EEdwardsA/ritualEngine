    "The careful text-books measure",

    "Lets down the grinding span,",
    "The blame of loss, or murder,",
    "Is laid upon the man.",

    "Not on the Steelâ€”the Man!",
    " ",
    "But in our daily dealing",
    "With stone and steel, we find",
    "The Gods have no such feeling",
    "Of justice toward mankind.",
    "To no set gauge they make us",
    "For no laid course prepare",
    "In time they overtake us",
    "With loads we cannot bear",

    "Too merciless to bear.",
    " ",
    "The prudent text-books give it",
    "In tables at the end",
    "The stress that shears a rivet",
    "Or makes a tie-bar bend",
    "What traffic wrecks macadam",
    "What concrete should endure",
    "But we, poor Sons of Adam",
    "Have no such literature,",

    "We hold all Earth to plunder",
    "All Time and Space as well",
