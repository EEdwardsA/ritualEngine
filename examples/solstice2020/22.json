    "The careful text-books measure",

    "The prudent text-books give it",
    "In tables at the end",
    "The stress that shears a rivet",
    "Or makes a tie-bar bend",
    "What traffic wrecks macadam",
    "What concrete should endure",
    "But we, poor Sons of Adam",
    "Have no such literature,",
