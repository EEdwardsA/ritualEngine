    "Countless winter nights ago,",
    "A woman shivered in the cold.",
    "Cursed the skies, and wondered why",
    "The gods invented pain.\n.",
    "Aching angry flesh and bone,",
    "Bitterly she struck the stone",
    "Till she saw the sudden spark",
    "Of light, and golden flame.\n.",
    "She showed the others, but they told her",
    "She was not fit to control",
    "The primal forces that the gods",
    "Had cloaked in mystery\n.",
    "But she would not be satisfied,",
    "And though she trembled, she defied them",
    "Took her torch and raised it high",
    "Set afire history.\n.",
    "      Tomorrow can be brighter than to-day,",
    "      although the night is cold.",
    "      The stars may seem so very far a-way...\n.",
    "      But courage, hope and reason burn,",
    "      In every mind, each lesson learned,",
    "      Shining light to guide our way",
    "      Make tomorrow brighter than to-day...\n.",
    "      Oh... Brighter than to-day.\n.",
    "Ages long forgotten now,",
    "We built the wheel and then the plough.",
    "Tilled the earth and proved our worth,",
    "Against the drought and snow.\n.",
    "Soon we had the time to fathom",
    "Mountain peaks and tiny atoms,",
    "Beating hearts electric sparks",
    "So much more to know.\n.",
    "      Tomorrow can be brighter than to-day,",
    "      although the night is cold.",
    "      The stars may seem so very far a-way...\n.",
    "      But courage, hope and reason grow",
    "      With every passing season so we’ll",
    "      Drive the darkness far away",
    "      Make tomorrow brighter than to-day...\n.",
    "      Oh... Brighter than to-day.\n.",
    "The universe may seem unfair.",
    "The laws of nature may not care.",
    "The storms and quakes, our own mistakes,",
    "They nearly doused our flame.\n.",
    "But all these trials we’ve endured",
    "The lessons learned, diseases cured",
    "Against our herculean task",
    "We’ve risen to proclaim.\n.",
    "      Tomorrow can be brighter than to-day,",
    "      although the night is cold.",
    "      The stars may seem so very far a-way...\n.",
    "      But courage, hope and reason bloom",
    "      Across the world and one day soon, we’ll",
    "      Rise up to the stars and say:",
    "      Make tomorrow brighter than today"
