      "Do you remember the flame and the ember? When fire was warm and safe and yellow?",
      "Do you remember the prose and the splendor? When speech burst forth from kin and fellow?",
      "Do you remember the sweet and the tender? The crops we sewed on hill and hollow?",
      "Try to remember and if you remember then follow...\n.",
      "Follow, Follow, Follow, Follow, Follow, Follow, Follow, Follow.\n.",
      "Do you remember the mystery enders? How lore was won and teaching bestowed?",
      "Do you remember how work was dismembered? Small step by step the energy flowed.",
      "Do you remember that day in September when war had come all life to swallow?",
      "Try to remember the order a man did not follow...\n.",
      "Follow, Follow, Follow, Follow, Follow, Follow, Follow, Follow.\n.",
      "Try to remember there's hope in the embers and bring a light where storms have swirled",
      "Try to remember a past of pretenders and keenly judge each flag unfurled",
      "Try to remember the strength at your center: you have the right to save the world",
      "If you remember then safer Septembers may follow\n.",
      "Follow, Follow, Follow, Follow, Follow, Follow, Follow, Follow.\n."
