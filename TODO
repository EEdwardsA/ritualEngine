* Fewer videos
** Smart?
*** Measure, either way
* Rotation with lyrics
* Names on Avatars

BBS stuff:
* new-style bucketing
* lyric timing acquisition
* assign rooms
* Don't calibrate volume if we skipped latency
* Investigate calibration buttons doing nothing when there are lots of avatars
* Readiness detector sometimes says 0/1/500 when it should say 1/1/500

Chat:
* Going away
* Avatars in chat?
